    """
    Predicts TAD scores for a sequence or a list sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequences : str or list
        string of single sequence or list of sequences to predict TADA scores for.

    overlap_length : int
        The length of the overlap between sequences.
        Default is 39
    
    pad : str
        The approach to pad your sequence. 
        Options are 'random' or 'GS'.
        GS will pad both sides of your sequence with GS.
        Random will pad both sides of your sequence with random amino acids.
        Default is 'GS'.
    
    approach : str
        The approach to pad your sequence. 
        Options are 'even' or 'N' or 'C'.
        Even will pad the sequence evenly on both sides.
        'N' will pad the sequence only at the N-terminus.
        'C' will pad the sequence only at the C-terminus.
        Default is 'even'.

    verbose : bool
        whether to warn user when sequence lengths are not 40 amino acids.

    safe_mode : bool
        whether to run the function in safe mode. Safe mode will raise an exception
        if any sequences are under 40 amino acids. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dict with the sequence as the key and the scores as the values.
